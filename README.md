Classic snake game, where the player controls WASD controls to move and collect food (dot) while avoiding obstacles (walls) and its own body.
However, this version, the snake will never die. If you are too close to the wall, the snake will just do the counter clockwise turn, and also if the snake  collides into its own body, it will just colours it. No worries.
